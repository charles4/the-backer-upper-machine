Outstanding Tasks
-----------------

The following is a list of things that are yet to do. Please remove
items as they get done.

  * distribution stuff

    - Move the "test" directory to the more standard "tests".

    - Make proper python unit tests that can be run using test.py.
    
    - Add support to Makefile for "make check".
 
    - Change setup.py to better leverage librsync's library building.
  
  * implementation stuff
  
    - Break pysync.py up into seperate module and program scripts.
    
    - Seperate out the input data handling into a ScanBuffer class.
    
    - Add inverse delta calculation/patch classes.
    
    - Fix/improve the librsync wrapper (abandon swig?)
    
    - Make pysync fallback to md5 and adler32 when md4 and rollsum are
    missing?
